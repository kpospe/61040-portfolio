# About Me
*My name is Kira Pospeshil. I'm a senior majoring in computer science and engineering.*

Some fun facts about me:
1. I've broken 2 bones
2. I do glassblowing
3. I'm from Los Angeles

My goals are to learn a lot and to complete all the assignments (harder than it sounds) :D

I'm also president of a dance team here on campus!
