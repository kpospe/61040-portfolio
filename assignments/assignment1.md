### 3 Expanded Domains

#### 1. Team scheduling and coordination

I’ve been both captain and treasurer of my college dance team, Mocha Moves.
All the time, but especially during IAP when we prepare for our winter show, the biggest challenges are scheduling, organization, and communication.
I've noticed these issues in many organized groups like run clubs, theater troupes, sports teams, and more.
This feels like fertile ground for a project because a small improvement in coordination tools can have an huge impact on people’s time and stress.

#### 2. Watching and selecting movies & TV for groups

I’m part of MIT’s Lecture Series Committee (LSC), which screens movies for the student body.
Even outside of that, I often find myself, my friends, and my family struggling to pick movies to watch together due to our differing tastes and watch histories.
This domain combines a personal hobby with my club experience, while being applicable to a large demographic.

#### 3. Studying effectively/Productivity habits

I was diagnosed with ADHD this semester, which helped me realize how much I struggle to balance classes, extracurriculars, and personal time.
I try to use incentives to motivate myself, but I still find it hard to keep track of commitments and stay consistent.Tools exist, but they often feel too rigid or don’t address how motivation and scheduling connect.
This topic is important to me and I'd benefit a lot from developing it further.

### 3 Selected Problems

- **Meeting scheduling conflicts**

Performance and professional teams alike struggle to find meeting times that work for the right subset of people, especially when members have different schedules and roles. Sometimes you need specific roles present (e.g. team leaders).

Other times you just need a minimum number of people.
Current solutions like when2meet or shared Google Calendar are clunky, get ignored, and don’t handle these nuanced constraints.

I selected this problem because I’ve seen how much frustration and wasted time it causes, and because it generalizes to many group contexts beyond my own team.

- **Wasting time scrolling for something to watch**

On average, people spend hours per week browsing streaming platforms or debating in group chats before settling on something to watch.
Often, the choice takes forever and is unsatisfactory.

The problem is amplified when watching with others: everyone has different tastes and subscriptions, and most recommendation systems are tuned for individuals, not groups.

I chose this problem because it is widespread, affects families and friend groups of all ages, and sits at the intersection of discovery, preference modeling, and group decision-making.

- **Staying motivated to complete tasks**

Students and professionals often know what they need to do but struggle to stay consistent.
People try personal reward systems or accountability systems with friends, but these are usually informal and fragile
Existing apps help track tasks or habits but rarely adapt to changing motivation or priorities.

I picked this problem because it combines productivity with psychology, which opens the door to more flexible, personalized support instead of a one-size-fits-all checklist.

### 6 Excluded Problems

- **Tracking finances and reimbursements**

This problem may be too niche or specific to different institutions.
Existing tools (spreadsheets, budgeting apps, Venmo notes) are already strong enough and customizable for this task.
The space is important but less aligned with my interest in coordination and time.

- **Sharing choreography and performance notes**

Many existing tools (Google Drive, Notion, video platforms) already support file sharing and annotation.
Meaningfully innovating here without just rebuilding a storage system feels out of scope for this course (and for me lol).

- **Coordinating with friends on what to watch**

This overlaps heavily with the broader “finding something to watch” problem.
If I solve group discovery and decision-making, coordination becomes part of that solution rather than a separate problem.

- **Forgetting movies you’ve heard of**

Apps like Letterboxd already do a good job of letting you track watchlists.
The main pain I’m interested in is not remembering titles, but deciding among them as a group.

- **Overcommitting and missing deadlines**

This feels too broad.
While it's easy to see how overcommitting can lead to missing deadlines but missing deadlines is too general to be specifically combatted.

- **Balancing academic/work responsibilities with extracurriculars**

I’d rather focus on a narrower, more actionable part of the problem.

Many apps already exist for this type of thing and I would not be innovating but just shuffling features that are out there.
(This is in contrast to my chosen problem, which would dive more into philosophy rather than just being a calendar/notes/reminder app.)

## Stakeholders for these problems

### Chosen Problem 1: Team Scheduling conflicts

- **Team members:** those who regularly attend but do not manage logistics

- **Team leaders:** those with greater responsibility facilitating group operations (e.g. executives, managers)

- **Event or space schedulers:** or those that interface with a group and relies on their efficiency (e.g. studio managers, campus staff)

**Impact:**

Team members are affected by constant rescheduling and unclear polls, which create frustration and make commitments harder to manage;
they want a simple, low-effort way to give availability.

Team leaders are heavily impacted because mismatched schedules and slow responses create delays and administrative burden;
they need fast quorum-finding tools that respect role and headcount requirements.

Event or space schedulers are disrupted by last-minute changes and unclear booking requests, and they benefit when teams can confirm times earlier and more reliably.

---

### Chosen Problem 2: Wasting time scrolling for something to watch

- **Decision-Makers/Hosts:** the person initiating the selection

- **Co-watchers:** those watching but not hosting

- **Streaming Platforms & Content Providers:** those whose content the group consumes

**Impact:**

Hosts feel social pressure to pick something “good” and lose time navigating indecision;
they want quicker, preference-aligned suggestions.

Co-watchers become disengaged when discussions drag on and want their preferences incorporated without extended debates.

Streaming platforms risk user dissatisfaction or churn when browsing becomes too long, so they benefit from tools that speed up selection and maintain positive engagement.

---

### Problem 3: Staying motivated to complete tasks

- **Unmotivated Person:** primary users seeking productivity help

- **Bosses, Managers, Collaborators:** those who depend on timely, consistent output from the user

- **Peers and Teammates:** group members affected by shared project delays

**Impact:**

Unmotivated users experience stress, missed deadlines, and inconsistent habits; they want tools that adapt to their motivational style and help sustain momentum.

Managers, professors, and collaborators are affected when deadlines slip or progress becomes unpredictable, and they benefit from more reliable follow-through.

Peers in group work are impacted when one person’s procrastination stalls collective progress, and they want clearer accountability and steadier contributions.

## Evidence & Comparables

### Selected Problem 1: Team scheduling conflicts

- Students increasingly over-schedule every aspect of their lives suggests that scheduling complexity is a real and pervasive pain point. [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/college-students-schedule-google-calendar-e2a3d796?), [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/08/14/lifestyle/college-kids-are-using-google-calendar-to-schedule-hookups/?)

- While direct statistics on team scheduling are scarce, widespread issues with group scheduling are well documented. Group scheduling apps like [Clockwise](https://www.getclockwise.com/blog/group-scheduling-apps-lineup?) and Doodle exist specifically because “finding available white space across calendars” among busy participants is a persistent pain point.

- Reports on “hyper-scheduling” among students and professionals show that calendars are used for almost every aspect of life, from classes and meetings to social events and even personal time. This increases the complexity of finding overlapping free time for groups.

**Comparables and limitations:**

  - **[Doodle](https://doodle.com/en/) / [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/)**
  
  Great at collecting availability and visualizing overlaps, but they usually assume you’re aiming for “everyone who was invited” or a simple majority.
  They do not support richer constraints like “must include these specific roles” or “at least N members of a subgroup,” so leaders still have to reason manually about which combinations are acceptable.

  - **Shared calendars ([Google Calendar](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en-US/products/calendar/), [Outlook](https://outlook.live.com/mail/))**
  
  Work well when everyone shares their calendar and is within the same organization, but teams and community groups often span different domains and privacy preferences.
  They also don’t natively support poll-style selection or quorum logic.

### Problem 2: Wasting time scrolling for something to watch

- A survey of 2,000 American streaming subscribers found that on average, people waste 110 hours per year—nearly five full days—just browsing streaming services trying to find something to watch. [Streaming Media Magazine](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/News/Online-Video-News/Lost-in-the-Stream-Survey-Finds-Americans-Waste-Nearly-Five-Days-a-Year-Just-Deciding-What-to-Watch-167376.aspx?), [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241218932475/en/Lost-in-the-Stream-Survey-Finds-Americans-Waste-Nearly-Five-Days-a-Year-Just-Deciding-What-to-Watch?)

* UX design commentary refers to this as “Netflix Syndrome”, where excessive choice leads to decision fatigue, ultimately reducing the time spent actually watching content. [Medium](https://medium.com/%40aryagawade2001/netflix-syndrome-a-ux-ui-case-study-on-the-paradox-of-choice-410a062cc403?), [UX Collective](https://uxdesign.cc/decision-fatigue-and-ux-a-case-study-c3efbb985007?)

**Comparables and limitations:**

  - **[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/)**

  Excellent for logging what you’ve watched, keeping lists, and discovering films through reviews and social features.However, it is primarily oriented around individual cinephiles.
  It doesn’t offer much tooling for *live* group decision-making.

  - **[Reelgood](https://reelgood.com/)**

  Helps users track where movies and shows are streaming and can aggregate watchlists across platforms.
  Its strength is in content discovery and availability tracking.
  But it still assumes a mostly individual user and doesn’t deeply support negotiation between multiple people’s preferences, constraints (e.g., “something under 2 hours we can all agree on”), or real-time group polling.

### Problem 3: Staying motivated to complete tasks

- Academic research and popular summaries agree that a large majority of college students procrastinate on coursework, which is linked to stress, poorer performance, and difficulty achieving long-term goals. [APA](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2010/01/procrastination?), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10297372/?), [Edutopia](https://www.edutopia.org/article/3-reasons-students-procrastinate-and-how-help-them-stop/?), [SolvingProcrastination](https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-statistics/?)

- Many sources emphasize that motivation fluctuates with context (sleep, mental health, workload) and that rigid, one-size-fits-all structures often fail when life gets chaotic. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination?), [Verywell Mind](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-psychology-of-procrastination-2795944?)

**Comparables and limitations:**

  - **[Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/home)**
  
  Gamifies tasks using RPG-style mechanics (including XP, levels, & parties).
  This works well for users who are motivated by game themes and consistent habits.
  However, its reward system is fairly fixed: if you’re not into the fantasy aesthetic, or if your motivation spikes and crashes, the game layer can start to feel like extra work rather than support.
  It also doesn’t adapt well to changing priorities or energy levels.

  - **[Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/)**

  A powerful, flexible task manager with labels, priorities, and natural-language due dates.
  It excels at organizing work but assumes the user will supply the motivation.
  It doesn’t offer built-in, personalized motivation strategies (e.g., dynamic rewards, variable difficulty, or accountability nudges) and generally treats all tasks the same, regardless of how emotionally or cognitively difficult they are.

## Features

### Problem 1: Rehearsal scheduling conflicts

- **Smart availability polls** - Collect availability and automatically suggest best times using uploaded schedules or quick slot selections.

- **Role and quota-aware constraints** — Allow leaders to specify that certain individuals or cohorts must be present (e.g., “choreographer + any 6 members of Lifts”) or that a minimum number of participants is required, not necessarily everyone.

- **Attendance logs** — Track who actually shows up for rehearsals, so teams can see patterns over time and adjust expectations or role assignments.

---

### Problem 2: Wasting time scrolling for something to watch

- **Smart shared wishlist** — Let individuals add movies/shows as they hear about them; combine them into group lists that surface only items available across everyone’s streaming services.

- **Group quick vote** — Provide simple polls or swipe-style voting to converge on a choice quickly, instead of long message threads.

- **Mood- and constraint-based filters** — Suggest options based on group mood (“light comedy,” “cozy comfort rewatch”), time constraints (“< 2 hours”), and content boundaries.

---

### Problem 3: Staying motivated to complete tasks

- **Custom rewards system** — Let users define their own reward structures (e.g., treats, breaks, episodes) and link them to specific tasks or categories.

- **Adaptive streak and progress tracking** — Use streaks and visual progress indicators, but allow for “planned breaks” and recovery so that one bad week doesn’t destroy long-term progress.

- **Peer accountability check-ins** — Enable small accountability groups where people can share goals, quick updates, or “done” checkmarks without needing heavy social features or public feeds.
