# Assignment 1: Problem Framing

## Domains

1. Dance team management and coordination

2. Student productivity habits

3. Watching and selecting movies

4. Food and meal planning

5. Room layout/organization

6. Getting involved in campus events

7. Studying effectively/Productivity habits

8. Social connection and maintaining friendships

9. Academic projects and GIT organization

10. Sleep and late-night phone use

## Three Expanded Domains

### 1. Team management and coordination

I’ve been both captain and treasurer of my college dance team, Mocha Moves. Coordinating rehearsals, handling finances, and keeping track of shows takes a lot of time and organization. I know firsthand how messy communication and logistics can get in student-run organizations, so this feels like fertile ground for a project.

### 2. Watching and selecting movies

I’m part of MIT’s Lecture Series Committee (LSC), which screens movies for the student body. Even outside of that, I often find myself or my friends struggling to pick movies to watch together. The process can be time-consuming and unsatisfying. This domain combines a personal hobby with my club experience, while being applicable to a large demographic.

### 3. Studying effectively/Productivity habits

Balancing classes, extracurriculars, and personal time is always a challenge. I use incentives to motivate myself, but I still find it hard to keep track of commitments and stay consistent. Tools exist, but they often feel too rigid or don’t address how motivation and scheduling connect.

## Problems in these domains

### Domain 1: Team management/scheduling

* Rehearsal scheduling conflicts

* Tracking finances and reimbursements

* Sharing choreography and performance notes

### Domain 2: Watching and selecting movies

* Wasting time scrolling for something to watch

* Coordinating with friends on what to watch

* Forgetting movies you’ve heard of but haven’t seen

### Domain 3: Student productivity/studying

* Overcommitting and missing deadlines

* Staying motivated to complete tasks

* Balancing academic work with extracurriculars

## Three Selected Problems

1. Rehearsal scheduling conflicts

Dance teams like mine struggle to find practice times that work for everyone, especially when members have different class schedules and commitments. Current solutions like Google Calendar polls are clunky and often ignored. I selected this because I’ve seen how much frustration and wasted time this causes.

2. Wasting time scrolling for something to watch
On average, people spend hours per week just browsing streaming platforms. I often end up watching something mediocre because of indecision. I chose this because the problem is widespread and highly relatable, and solutions (like Netflix recommendations) often miss the mark.

3. Staying motivated to complete tasks
Students often know what they need to do but struggle to stay consistent. I personally rely on reward systems, and I know many peers do similar things informally. I picked this because it combines productivity with psychology, which could lead to creative features.

## Excluded Problems (with reasons)

### Team related

Dance team: Tracking finances and reimbursements → Too niche; existing spreadsheet/finance tools are already strong enough.

Dance team: Sharing choreography and performance notes → Hard to innovate meaningfully without just being a file-sharing app. Most upgrades I imagine are way out of my skillset.

### Movie related
Movies: Coordinating with friends on what to watch → Slightly more narrow than the “finding movies” issue, which already covers this indirectly.

Movies: Forgetting movies you’ve heard of → Already solved decently by apps like Letterboxd, which has a lot of features on its own.

### Scheduling related

Scheduling: Overcommitting and missing deadlines → Feels too broad and overlaps with general time management. I think any improvement ultimately is up to the person to internalize and can't really be fixed with an app.

Scheduling: Balancing academic work with extracurriculars → Very context-specific; solutions would likely be too generic or require non-software intervention. Many apps already exist and I would not be innovating but just shuffling features that are out there.

## Stakeholders

### Problem 1: Team Scheduling conflicts

Team members — dancers (or other team members) with busy schedules

Team leaders — captains/executives who manage logistics

Event organizers — people who depend on teams showing up prepared

Impact: Team members suffer stress from constant rescheduling. Leaders waste time managing logistics. Event organizers risk poor-quality performances if practice is inconsistent.

### Problem 2: Wasting time scrolling for something to watch

Viewer (selector) — person leading the decision

Friends/partners — others watching together

Streaming platforms — companies that want users engaged

Impact: Viewers and friends lose time and enjoyment. Platforms may benefit from longer browsing, but risk frustrating users.

### Problem 3: Staying motivated to complete tasks

Students — primary users seeking productivity help

Professors/teaching staff — affected by late or incomplete work

Peers/team members — impacted when group work lags
Impact: Students lose consistency, professors see reduced performance, peers suffer from uneven contributions.

## Evidence & Comparables

### Problem 1: Team scheduling conflicts

* While direct statistics on dance team scheduling are scarce, widespread issues with group scheduling are well documented. For instance, group scheduling apps like Clockwise arise in response to the common challenge of "finding available white space across calendars" among busy participants. [Clockwise](https://www.getclockwise.com/blog/group-scheduling-apps-lineup?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Students increasingly over-schedule every aspect of their lives—boarded by Google Calendar for academics, social hangouts, and even dates—suggests that scheduling complexity is a real and pervasive pain point.[The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/college-students-schedule-google-calendar-e2a3d796?utm_source=chatgpt.com),[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/08/14/lifestyle/college-kids-are-using-google-calendar-to-schedule-hookups/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Broader user-experience research highlights that fragmented calendars cause "calendar creep" and stress—especially in contexts where syncing and coordination are inadequately supported. (Derived from news narratives above.)

### Problem 2: Wasting time scrolling for something to watch

* A survey of 2,000 American streaming subscribers found that on average, people waste 110 hours per year—nearly five full days—just browsing streaming services trying to find something to watch. [Streaming Media Magazine](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/News/Online-Video-News/Lost-in-the-Stream-Survey-Finds-Americans-Waste-Nearly-Five-Days-a-Year-Just-Deciding-What-to-Watch-167376.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241218932475/en/Lost-in-the-Stream-Survey-Finds-Americans-Waste-Nearly-Five-Days-a-Year-Just-Deciding-What-to-Watch?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* UX design commentary refers to this as “Netflix Syndrome”, where excessive choice leads to decision fatigue, ultimately reducing the time spent actually watching content.[Medium](https://medium.com/%40aryagawade2001/netflix-syndrome-a-ux-ui-case-study-on-the-paradox-of-choice-410a062cc403?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [UX Collective](https://uxdesign.cc/decision-fatigue-and-ux-a-case-study-c3efbb985007?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Journalistic coverage also confirms that “too much content” and bloated libraries make it harder for users to pick something—many feel overwhelmed and frustrated despite algorithmic recommendations.

### Problem 3: Staying motivated to complete tasks

* Academic research indicates 80–95% of college students procrastinate, especially with coursework, making it one of the most prevalent issues in post-secondary education. [APA](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2010/01/procrastination?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10297372/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Edutopia](https://www.edutopia.org/article/3-reasons-students-procrastinate-and-how-help-them-stop/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [SolvingProcrastination](https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Long-form summaries (e.g., Wikipedia) note that academic procrastination is “highly prevalent,” with over 70% of students admitting to it, and link it to stress, poorer grades, and mental health challenges. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Additional sources underscore that procrastination is tied to performance gaps and self-regulation failures—and can seriously impact academic outcomes. [Verywell Mind](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-psychology-of-procrastination-2795944?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
